<h3>Anytime Approximate Computing</h3>
		<p>The ongoing growth of large-scale smart cities, internet-of-things, and deep neural networks continually increase the demand for computation. Such demand is expected to outgrow the capabilities of current computational infrastructure and presents new challenges in the design of large high-performance computing systems. My research objective is to leverage my expertise on error correction coding and communication theory in a novel way to develop methods for distributed approximate computing. My research interest is motivated by recognition of three fundamental trends in data and computing</p>

<p>&bull; First is the recognition that there is significant uncertainty in data due to statistical noise and algorithmic
limitations. E.g., sensor data collected from the internet-of-things are inherently noisy.</p>
<p>&bull; Second, many computationally intensive data processing problems do not require exact computation.
E.g., in human interaction with digital media there is inherent tolerance to approximation or "distortion".</p>
<p>&bull; Third is the recognition that the precision of traditional computing comes at a steep price in power and
delay. E.g., in parallel computing, finishing times depend on the slowest workers, resulting in delay.</p>

<p>In this context, the uncertainty of processed information stems from three axes; data uncertanity, algorithm uncertanity, and computing uncertanity. Although removing individual uncertainties can be important, such strategies do not provide guidelines on how to remove the uncertainties in all three axes synergistically. The result is unnecessary delay and power consumption. E.g., if data or algorithmic uncertainty introduces an error
probability of 10^-8, improving computing precision beyond 10^-8 will not improve the precision of the final output, while power is unnecessarily consumed and additional delay is introduced. My research interest is in the design of methods that reduce uncertainties along all three axes jointly. Such an approach can improve various metrics including power reduction and computational acceleration. I explore the use of such parallelized approximate computing methods in data processing problems, especially those that are
intrinsically robust to inexact computing such as multimedia coding, data analytics, and machine learning.</p>

<p>The methods that I develop have a significant impact, providing wide-reaching benefits across the information and communication technology sector. Companies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, Netflix, and others, incur enormous energy costs to perform exact computation. Thus, it is not the purchase of the hardware that dominates costs, but the operation thereof, of which energy is a significant component. The approximate computing methods that I develop may run on mobile platforms, in data-centers or in high-performance computing servers. These designs will save power and delay with respect to current technologies and they will result in great economic savings. Furthermore, the environmental impact of information and communication technology sector is growing. This is a central concern to the world and growing importance on the national stage. At 2% of global CO2 emissions, the operation of data centers also incurs great environmental costs. Improvements in operating efficiency can, therefore, yield massive economic and environmental returns.</p>

<h3>Low complexity lattice codes</h3>

<p>The development of the internet-of-things (IoT) and increasing number of cellular users require many fold capacity increases in wireless networks. One way to increase capacity is to use high data rate channel codes. Current standards use codes defined over binary field in conjunction with higher-order modulation. This approach is far from capacity and power efficient. Further, these approaches do not provide the necessary
structure to work effectively in multi-user networks, which is an essential aspect of future wireless networks. Lattice codes are proven to achieve the capacity of additive white Gaussian noise channel. Furthermore, their capacity achieving property, together with the lattice group structure make lattice code an ideal channel coding candidate for multi-user communication networks.</p>

<p>In order for lattice codes to achieve capacity, they need to have a large block length. A drawback to lattice codes is that there is no practical low complexity method to build high dimensional lattice codebooks. In my research, I pioneered the construction of low complexity lattice codebooks for high dimensional lattice codes. I took an innovative approach by using a concatenated version of low dimensional lattice codes to build high-dimensional lattice codebooks that operate near capacity. Then, I applied these approaches to multi-terminal networks. I believe that this approach has great potential for use to the wireless standards.</p>
